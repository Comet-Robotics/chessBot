## Tests

To run tests:

1. Install the VS Code jest testing extension. Make sure to install the pre-release version, as the current version doesn't properly display test output.

2. Use the Testing pane in VS Code to trigger tests.

Jest may also be run in watch mode, which will automatically re-run tests in response to file changes.
