## Setup

To run the website on your local machine:

1. Run `yarn install` to download necessary packages.
2. Run `yarn dev` to launch the dev server. This launches an express server which automatically builds and serves the client.
3. Open [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) in your browser.

Note vite will automatically watch both the server and the client code for changes and push updates to the browser automatically - no reloading required.

## Tests

To run tests:

1. Install the VS Code jest testing extension.
2. Use the Testing pane in VS Code to trigger tests.

Jest may also be run in watch mode, which will automatically re-run tests in response to file changes.
