# Welcome to chessBots!

## Setup

To run the website on your local machine:

1. Run either the VS Code **Install dependencies** task or `yarn install` to download necessary packages.
2. Run either the VS Code **Development server** task or `yarn dev` to launch the dev server. This will launch an express server which will automatically build and serve the client to port 3000.
3. Open [localhost:3000](http:/localhost:3000) in your browser.

Note vite will automatically watch both the server and the client code for changes and push updates to the browser automatically - no reloading required.

## Tests

To run tests, use the `Run tests` VS Code task.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found in the `./docs` folder. To generate documentation, run `npx typedoc` in the root folder.
