## Project Setup
In order to work with the project, you must build the client when making changes, and launch the server in order to serve the client and server logic.
Follow the below steps.

### building the client
- in order to test production setup, you must build the client
- open the "chess-bot-client" folder in terminal
- run "npm install" to install node packages.
- run "npm run build" to build
- a static version of the client is now ready!

### webServer
- open the webServer folder in terminal
- run "npm install" to install node packages.
- run "npm start"

- Access the client via localhost:3000
