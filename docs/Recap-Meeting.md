# Recap Meeting

## Demo Goals

The current goal is to get working bots for a chess study demo.

The goal is to be able to setup and play simple chess endgame studies like a rook or queen checkmate.

## Software Goals

### Needs

1. We need to add UI for chess endgame studies
2. We need to connect the client moves to the physical bots:
    - The moves need to work.
    - We need to construct moves.
3. Add the ability to set variables to the debug page

### Wants

1. Synchronized movement/show

### Wishes

1. GUI visualizer
2. Setup and Teardown?

## Hardware Goals

### Needs

1. We need to get and assemble working robots
2. We need to program driving routines
3. We need to program using the line sensors to align with a square

# Recap Meeting

## Good

1. Non-leads writing code!
    - Gabriel has been involved, writing code
    - Adam has also been here
    - Implemented select UI all by himself
2. UI is coming along pretty good
3. Hardware components ordered

## Bad/Ugly

1. Mason, Alex, and Dylan hasn't been writing much code
    - Alex has been mentoring, not much focus time
2. Dylan and Mason feeling disconnected from the codebase
3. Issues are piling up, a lot of drafts/backlog - out of issues
    - Alex has been main one writing issues
    - Issue quality has been declining
4. New member engagement has been falling
5. Nick has been rebuilding robots/hardware problems
6. Documentation is dead
7. Issue accountability/dead issues

# Retrospective

1. Mason, Alex, and Dylan hasn't been writing much code
2. Try to renew engagement
    - Dylan - write a message asking people to come more
    - One on one messages/talks?
    - Improve issue writing process
3. Training Pipeline
4. Issue accountability
5. Need to associate Github with Discord
6. No eating during ChessBots meetings
7. Documentation

# Conclusions

1. No eating during ChessBots meetings/no leaving for more than 20 minutes
    - 7-9 on Monday, 6-8 on Friday
2. Ticket writing sessions
    - 1 hour before the meeting each Friday (e.g. 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm)
3. Implement applications/specific commitments for next year?
    - Class cutoff - 2337 or simple coding exercise
4. Issue Accountability - Leave a comment on your issue at least every week
